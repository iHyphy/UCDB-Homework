            <p class="About Me"> Hi, My name is Manraj Uppal. I have been interested in computers ever since I had first experienced the crazy things 
                    it was doing that I as a kid couldnt even phathom. One of the many things I had enjoyed was video games. Video games 
                    are basically crazy simulations that we can run on computers.
